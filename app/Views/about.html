    Hi, I'm Madushan and welcome to my personal website.
</p>

<p>
    I like to keep a balance between work and leisure. I challenge myself at work as a software developer and always find ways to incorporate new developments in the field into my work. I am also building my project management skills as this is an area I would like to pursue further.

    I consider myself somewhat social.I enjoy playing tennis and golf whenever I get the change. I like trying different specialty brews with my friends. I like too keep a tasteful presence on social media like <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/damiththa">twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiththa">LinkedIn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/damiththa">Instagram</a>, and find me on <a href="https://interestsme.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.</a>
