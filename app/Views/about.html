    Hi, I'm Madushan and welcome to my personal website.
</p>

<p>
    I like to keep a balance between work and leisure. I challenge myself at work as a software developer and always find ways to incorporate new developments in the field into my work. I am also building my project management skills as this is an area I would like to pursue further. Feel free to check out my StackOverFlow, GitHub, and CodePen Playground for an idea of my programming interests. 
</p>

<p>
    I consider myself somewhat social.I enjoy playing tennis and golf whenever I get the change. I like trying different specialty brews with my friends. I like too keep a tasteful presence on social media like LinkedIn, twitter, and Instagram. You can also find me on WordPress.
</p>

<p>
    I believe in the importance of doing good for others and support two Charity:Water campaigns a year and am a big supporter/participant of Movember. 
</p>

<p>
    On average throughout the year, I try to have at least two <a class="popoverData" data-target="#" data-content="{{CharityWater_Intro}}" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="Charity: Water" data-trigger="hover" href="https://my.charitywater.org/damiththa" target="_blank">Charity: Water</a> campaigns.
    However, month of November is solely dedicated to <a class="popoverData" data-target="#" data-content="{{Movember_Intro}}" rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="Movember" data-trigger="hover" href="https://mobro.co/damiththa" target="_blank">Movember</a>.
</p>

<p>
    And finally, I'm (somewhat) social. Follow me on <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/damiththa">twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damiththa">LinkedIn</a> to 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://instagram.com/damiththa">Instagram</a>, check out my
